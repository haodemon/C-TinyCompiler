=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the machinery necessary to easily call C functions from
Perl with arbitrarily many arguments. The types of the arguments are a bit
restricted at the moment, but it nonetheless works for a fairly broad variety
of things. In particular, it handles pointers just fine.

Like all other C::TinyCompiler packages, you make this module available as a package to your
compiler state either by indicating it as an argument to your state's
constructor or by applying the package later:

 # Create compiler state with C::TinyCompiler::Callable
 my $compiler = C::TinyCompiler->new('C::TinyCompiler::Callable');
 # Slighly abbreviated:
 my $compiler = C::TinyCompiler->new('::Callable');
 
 # Adding it after construction:
 my $compiler = C::TinyCompiler->new;
 $compiler->apply_packages('C::TinyCompiler::Callable');

The primary operation of this package is to scan through your code, identify
functions for which you want to build Perl functions, and build the necessary
C and Perl code. You indicate which of your functions should have Perl
interfaces by preceding them "immediately" with the package name:

 $compiler->code('Body') .= q{
     /* This will have a Perl interface */
     C::TinyCompiler::Callable
     void do_something(int arg1, double arg2) {
         ...
     }
     
     /* This will not have a Perl interface */
     void something_else (double foo, int bar) {
         ...
     }
     
     C::TinyCompiler::Callable  /* Also has a Perl interface */
     void third_func(int arg1, double arg2) {
         ...
     }
     
     /* comments among arguments is even ok */
     C::TinyCompiler::Callable
     void get_height_and_temp (
         /* Input: grid, location on the grid, and time of day */
         grid * my_grid, int x, int y, int time,
         /* Output: height and temperature of that position at that time */
         double * height, double * temperature
     ) {
         ...
     }

 };

The extraction parser does not care about whitespace, and is smart enough to
consider classic C-style comments (i.e. C</* comment */> but not C<// comment>)
as whitespace. This is true even within the function's arguments (i.e.
C<get_height_and_temp>) and between the Callable declaration and the function
declaration (i.e. C<third_func>).

Just before your code is run through the preprocessor, each function marked as
callable will be examined and a new C-level invocation function with a standard
argument layout will be added to the C<Foot> section. Also, the text for a Perl
function that knows the name of the C-level invocation function and knows how to
invoke it will be generated.

After you have compiled your code, you can obtain a Perl subref that invokes
your code by calling the C<get_callable_subref> method, supplying the function's
name. You can then invoke this method with your Perl arguments.

=head2 Basic Usage

The basic usage was already demonstrated in the Synopsis. If you use basic C
types, you should be able to just put C<C::TinyCompiler::Callable> before the function
declaration and you will be able to invoke your code from Perl in the obvious
way.

=head2 Working with pointers and C-level arrays

There are many ways that your Perl code might refer to arbitrary C data. One is
to have a Perl scalar whose integer value is the pointer address. Another is
to have the actual binary data stored in a Perl's PV slot, which is ordinarily
reserved for the string portion of the scalar. Since there is no clean way to
ascertain your scalar's provenance, C::TinyCompiler::Callable introduces the following
convention: if your scalar is a I<reference>, it assumes that the PV slot of the
I<referent> is a binary blob, and uses I<the address of that PV slot> as the
argument for a pointer. If your scalar is I<not a reference>, it assumes that
the I<IV slot> of I<your scalar> is a pointer address.

How does this work in practice? If you need to pass a string to your C code,
pass a I<reference> to the actual variable holding the data instead of passing
the variable itself:

 my $is_legit = $confirm_id->(\$user_id, \$user_password);
 #                            ^          ^
 # note reference             |          |

Similarly, if you pack a collection of data, you pass a reference to that
packed collection:

 my $packed_data = pack 'd*', @values;
 my $sum = $sum_data->(\$packed_data, scalar(@values));
 #                     ^
 # note referece       |

If you are an XS module writer and you want to allow somebody to get a hold of
a pointer to some data so they can manipulate it, you simply use C<PTR2IV>:

 /* in XS */
 IV
 get_pointer_for_array(self)
     SV * self
     CODE:
         ...
         RETVAL = PTR2IV(data_array);;
     OUTPUT:
         RETVAL

The resulting scalar will be perfect for sending to a function that expects a
pointer:

 my $data_ptr = $obj->get_pointer_for_array;
 my $length = $obj->length;
 my $sum = $sum_data->($data_ptr, $length);
 #                     ^
 # No reference!       |

=head2 Directly Passing an SV *

It may be that you want to write a function that directly manipulates 
an C<SV*>. For such a task, using XS::TCC is probably the better 
TCC-related tool for this job. You can use C::TinyCompiler, though. 
First, you will need to include C<C::TinyCompiler::Perl> in your compiler
context. Then, your C function will have an C<SV*> in the argument list:

 $context = C::TinyCompiler->new('::Perl', '::Callable');
 $context->code('Body') = q{
 C::TinyCompiler::Callable
     void my_set_IV (SV * a, int b) {
         sv_setiv(a, b);
     }
 };
 $context->compile;

Finally, when calling the function, I<you must pass a reference to the
scalar that you want sent to the function>:

 my $my_set_IV = $context->get_callable_subref('my_set_IV');
 my $to_set;
 
 # Set variable to 10
 $my_set_IV->(\$to_set, 10);

I know, this is annoying, but I couldn't find a way to get the original 
SV to the C function. And if we can't get the original SV to the C 
function, then the C function wouldn't be able to make any 
modifications to the SV. And what's the fun in that?

=head2 Working with Perl-level objects

If you have Perl objects with data that you want to pass to a Callable
function, you can add the C<pack_as> method to your class to make life easier.
When your function gets an object, it will ask it if it can pack as the needed
type, such as C<int> or C<double *>. This way your object can present meaningful
data when used as an argument.

Assuming the ficticious object mentioned in the previous section holds an array
of doubles, one could implement a C<pack_as> method for tha class like so:

 sub pack_as {
     my ($self, $type) = @_;
     return $self->length if $type eq 'int';
     return $self->get_pointer_for_array
         if $type =~ /^double\s*[*]$/;
     croak('Foo can only be cast by C::TinyCompiler::Callable as a double* or int');
 }

Then the user could invoke the C<my_sum> function from the synopsis like so:

 my $sum = $my_sum_subref->($obj, $obj);

=head2 Caveats about Speed

This is an interface to C::TinyCompiler, and the resulting code compiles down to C code.
However, the code generated this way still has to jump through a lot of hoops.

I have tried to optimize the generated code as much as possible, but the path
from your Perl invocation of the generated subref to your actual C code
involves: (1) invoking the subref with your arguments, which goes on to
(2) unpack those arguments from C<@_>, (3) ask those arguments if they are
objects and know how to cast themselves to the required C type, and if not use a
default casting mechanism, (4) C<pack> all of the arguments into a single C
binary buffer, (5) build a return binary buffer, (6) call an XS "trampoline"
that calls the C wrapper with the input and output binary buffers, which
(7) unpacks the binary input buffer into C variables, (8) invokes the original
function with the unpacked C variables, (9) packs the return value into the
supplied binary return buffer and returns (it's actually a void function),
bringing us back to the subref which (10) unpacks the binary return buffer and
returns the value.

Contrast those steps with the steps needed for calling a simple xsub wrapper.
The steps involve (1) invoking the xsub with your arguments in Perl which
(2) unpacks the stack in your XS/C code, (3) invokes the original function with
the unpacked C variables, and (4) packs the return value(s) into SVs and places
them on the return stack.

In short, don't use this sort of functionality to add two integers. If you need
to perform complicated time stepping on a mesh, though, the extra overhead of
the function invocation will be relatively innocuous.

=head1 SEE ALSO

There are a number of modules or tools that do something similar to what
C::TinyCompiler::Callable does. All of these modules use another compiler to generate the
object code in use, so they will present tradeoffs in compile time and
execution time compared with C::TinyCompiler::Callable.

L<C::TinyCompiler::Perl> pulls in all of the Perl headers, which in principle would allow
you to write your own Perl-callable C functions that manipulate the stack and
everything. Of course, that is not documented and it's likely to be quite
verbose, so it's not for the faint of heart. But in principle, that mechanism
provides another way to generate hooks so you can call C functions from Perl.

For a runtime foreign function interface, see L<FFI::Raw>, which mostly
supersedes L<FFI> (though the latter might be worth looking into). This module
uses assembly to build a C stack and then directly fire your C function.
Building the stack takes a little more effort on your part, but those details
can easily be encapsulated in a Perl-side wrapper. The only reason I didn't
use that module as this module's C function caller is that it is not (yet) as
general as I would like and I didn't want to introduce another nontrivial
dependency. 

A more powerful means for building C functions and calling them from Perl is
L<Inline::C>. This has the full power of XS, and the full optimization of your
local compiler, but is not designed to quickly compile. Generally, I find that
L<Inline::C> is a great means for prototyping my XS code, but the assumption is
that eventually the codebase will reach a stable state. If you need to
dynamically generate lots of different C functions throughout your code's
execution, the compiler invocation overhead of L<Inline::C> will likely not pay
off compared to the speed of tcc's compilation.

If your goal is to write a stable set of C functions that can be called from
Perl, you should ultimately look into Perl's C interface layer, L<perlxs>. XS is
generally meant to be used in the context of a module or suite of modules, and
it is nicely wrapped by L<Inline::C> (and more basically by L<Inline::XS>).
If you do not need to generate C code on the fly, this is the best means for
writing code that quickly invokes and executes. The Perl hooks into your code
will be the most direct of all of these options, and the generated object code
will be optimized by your compiler in ways that tcc likely will not be.
